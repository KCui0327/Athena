1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
everybody's talking about artificial

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,759
intelligence these days AI machine

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,240
learning is another Hot Topic are they

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,919
the same thing or are they different and

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,879
if so what are those differences and

6
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:17,719
deep learning is another one that comes

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,480
into play I actually did a video on

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,439
these three artificial intelligence

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,719
machine learning and deep learning and

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,359
talked about where they fit and there

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,800
were a lot of comments on that and I

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,400
read those comments and I'd like to

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,519
address some of the most frequently

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,400
asked questions so that we clear up some

15
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,120
of the myths and misconceptions around

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,998
this in addition something else has

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,280
happened since that video was recorded

18
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:43,840
and that is this the absolute explosion

19
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:47,359
of this area of generative AI things

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,440
like large language models and chat Bots

21
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,679
have seemed to be taking over the world

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,560
we see them everywhere really

23
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:57,079
interesting technology uh and then also

24
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,959
things like deep fakes these are all

25
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,000
within the realm of AI but how do they

26
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:00,000
fit within each other how are they
