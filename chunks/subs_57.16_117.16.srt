1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,399
things like deep fakes these are all

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,198
within the realm of AI but how do they

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,959
fit within each other how are they

4
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:08,880
related to each other we're going to

5
00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:10,440
take a look at that in this video and

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,400
try to explain how all these

7
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:15,039
Technologies relate and how we can use

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,160
them first off a little bit of a

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,319
disclaimer I'm going to have to simplify

10
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:22,519
some of these Concepts in order to not

11
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:24,200
make this video last for a week so those

12
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,080
of you that are really deep experts in

13
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,999
the field apologies in advance but we're

14
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,998
going to try to make this simple and and

15
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:33,319
that will involve some generalizations

16
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:36,120
first of all let's start with AI

17
00:00:33,319 --> 00:00:39,080
artificial intelligence is basically

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,319
trying to simulate with a computer

19
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:45,079
something that would match or exceed

20
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:46,319
human intelligence what is intelligence

21
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,998
well it could be a lot of different

22
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:51,080
things but generally we tend to think of

23
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:53,400
it as the ability to learn to infer and

24
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,119
to reason things like that so that's

25
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,879
what we're trying to do in the broad

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,000
field of AI of artificial intelligence

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,000
and if we look at a timeline of AI it
